```

## üéÅ Example Products

```python
products.Product("MacBook Air M2", price=1450, quantity=100)
products.NonStockedProduct("Windows License", price=125)
products.LimitedProduct("Shipping", price=10, quantity=250, maximum=1)
```

## üîñ Adding Promotions

Promotions can be assigned like so:

```python
macbook.promotion = promotions.SecondHalfPrice("Second Half Price!")
license.promotion = promotions.PercentDiscount("30% off!")
```

During checkout, the pricing logic will automatically apply any active promotion.
